 		<h2>Greetings to the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket,</h2>
 		<p>
 			From The Peanut Butter Tamer Himself, Jif Skipper! I shake you warmly by the hand. I do invite you come for a day of adventure inside the peanut butter factory for one whole day. Afterwards, the oopma loompas will come out to play. Do you know what that means? It's time to party... inside the peanut butter factory! To see what wonders await, bring a friend to look after you, wear snazzy clothes, and don't worry about the peanut butter. We'll have lots in stock.  <strong>Bring your ticket</strong>! Until then,
 		</p>
